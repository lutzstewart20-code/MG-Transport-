# MG Transport Services - Firebase Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your MG Transport system to Firebase hosting, replacing the PHP/MySQL backend with Firebase services.

## 🚀 What's Changed

Your system has been converted from PHP/MySQL to:
- **Firebase Hosting** - Static file hosting
- **Firebase Authentication** - User management
- **Firestore Database** - NoSQL database
- **Firebase Storage** - File uploads (licenses, receipts)

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
2. **Firebase CLI** tools
3. **Firebase account** (free tier available)
4. **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Step 2: Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate with your Google account.

### Step 3: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Enter project name: `mg-transport-services`
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

### Step 4: Initialize Firebase in Your Project

```bash
firebase init
```

Select the following options:
- **Hosting** ✅
- **Firestore** ✅
- **Storage** ✅
- **Functions** ❌ (not needed for this project)

When prompted:
- Select your project: `mg-transport-services`
- Public directory: `public`
- Single-page app: `Yes`
- Overwrite index.html: `No`

### Step 5: Configure Firebase Services

#### 5.1 Update Firebase Config

Edit `public/js/firebase-config.js` and replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
    authDomain: "mg-transport-services.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "mg-transport-services",
    storageBucket: "mg-transport-services.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

You can find these values in your Firebase project settings.

#### 5.2 Enable Authentication

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Authentication**
2. Click **Get started**
3. Enable **Email/Password** provider
4. Click **Save**

#### 5.3 Setup Firestore Database

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database**
3. Choose **Start in test mode** (for development)
4. Select a location close to your users
5. Click **Done**

#### 5.4 Setup Storage

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Storage**
2. Click **Get started**
3. Choose **Start in test mode** (for development)
4. Select a location close to your users
5. Click **Done**

### Step 6: Deploy to Firebase

```bash
# Deploy everything
firebase deploy

# Or deploy specific services
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase deploy --only firestore
firebase deploy --only storage
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Firebase not initialized"**
   - Check `firebase-config.js` has correct values
   - Ensure Firebase SDK is loaded before your scripts

2. **"Permission denied"**
   - Check Firestore and Storage security rules
   - Verify user authentication status

3. **"Collection not found"**
   - Ensure Firestore database is created
   - Check collection names match exactly

4. **Deployment fails**
   - Verify Firebase CLI is logged in
   - Check project ID matches
   - Ensure all required files exist

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in browser console:
```javascript
// Add to firebase-config.js
firebase.firestore().settings({
    debug: true
});
```

3. **Configure custom domain** (optional)
4. **Set up monitoring** and analytics
5. **Train your team** on the new system
